      An edger is used to trim the lawn along a hard surface like a driveway or sidewalk. They cut a nice clean edge. This is included with lawn our lawn service.</p>
</div>
  <div class="row">
    <h3>Fertilizer</h3>
      <p class="tips">Most soils are not able to provide all nutrients needed for your grass to develop thick, green, and
    weed free. We fertilize grass in order to promote leaf and root growth, aid in recovery from foot traffic and pest damage.
    It also reduces and helps control weeds. There are 2 types of fertilizer liquid and granular fertilizers we apply either one depending on customer consent.</p>
</div>
  <div class="row">
    <h3>Weed Control</h3>
    <p class="tips">  Lawn weeds such as crabgrass and dandelions pose one of the most persistent and annoying challenges
      in the great American quest to grow decent grass. The fertilizer we apply to your lawn is a combination of both fertilizer
      and weed control. As nutrients are released, the root system of your grass fills in any bare patches,
      this in itself promotes lawn weed control, depriving weed seeds of a place to germinate. Thus creating a beautiful, thick, green lawn.</p>
</div>
  <div class="row">
    <h3>Aerating</h3>
      <p class="tips">Even with the best care available, lawns can thin out and lose color due to excessive thatch buildup, too much foot traffic or pet traffic through specific areas that create hard or compacted soils, or periods of high temperature, high humidity, or drought. Aerating and overseeing is recognized by turf experts such as golf course superintendents as the best treatment to control thatch, helps reduce those compacted areas, fills in bare spots and revitalize growth An aeration treatment removes small cores of soil and thatch to allow air, moisture and nutrients to penetrate down to the root zone. The cores brought to the surface contain microorganisms, which help the breakdown of the woody thatch tissue layer just below the lawn's crown. As the thatch layer is broken down, it is converted into organic matter that will then combine with existing soil particles. Also, as the cores begin to breakdown over a period of several weeks, the holes gradually fill in with a mixture of organic matter and soil, and the filled hole allows roots of existing grass plants to spread out and grow deeper,
         creating a healthier, thicker lawn.</p>
</div>
  <div class="row">
    <h3>De-Thatch</h3>
      <p class="tips">Thatch is the built-up of plant material between green growth and the grass roots, is essential, but too much can deter healthy lawn growth. The best time to dethatch your lawn is just before your lawn's most vigorous growth cycle. The best time to dethatch a cool season lawn is late August to Early October depending on your area. During this time the grass is growing vigorously and should recover quickly. Dethatching in the fall is also recommended because at this time the weed seeds are not germinating so that your grass does not have to compete with them.</p>
</div>
  <div class="row">
    <h3>Mulch</h3>
      <p class="tips">Mulch is any type of material that is spread or laid over the surface of the soil as a covering. It is used to retain moisture in the soil, suppress weeds, keep the soil cool and make the garden bed look more attractive. Organic mulches also help improve the soil’s fertility, as they decompose. Wood chips are a very popular mulch because of its neat appearance, as well as its hardiness. We carry mulch in Brick Red, Cedar Color, Chestnut, Walnut (Dark Brown), Beer Nuts and even New York Jets Black.  </p>
</div>
  <div class="row">
    <h3>Sod</h3>
      <p class="tips">To start new lawns, or even repair damaged lawns, many people wonder which is better:
        laying sod or sowing grass seed. While seeding is cheaper and offers a wider variety of grass types, many
        people are won over to laying sod. Laying sod is fast and produces high-quality new lawns. In fact, laying sod is so fast, it's fair to say it gives you an "instant lawn.</p>
</div>
  <div class="row">
    <h3>Over Seeding</h3>
      <p class="tips">Over seeding is an overlooked activity in American home lawn care. Gardeners assume that fertilizer is all that is needed to keep a turf thick and free of weeds. Grass gets tired. It needs to be revitalized every few years. Over seeding is one of the most important lawn care tasks, yet few homeowners ever do it. Over seeding compensates for that natural slow down of the turf's reproduction. There are two major benefits to over seeding every three or four years. First, you insure your lawn stays thick and dense, or if it has thinned, you will make it thick again. Thick grass has few if any weeds if it is mowed over 2
        inches tall. The second benefit is disease resistance. The new varieties of seed you sow this year will have better disease resistance than
        those varieties already in your lawn.</p>
</div>
  <div class="row">
    <h3>Grub Control</h3>
      <p class="tips">One such pest actually eats the roots of grass. This pest is quite common and can appear anywhere in the United States. Grubs are the larval stage of beetles. There are many types of grubs but the ones which live in the dirt under grass are most likely Japanese Beetle, June Beetle, May Beetle, Black Turfgrass, Asiatic Garden or some other regional beetle which lays eggs whose larva feed on plants Grubs can vary greatly in size Grubs live just under grass, usually 6 inches to a few feet down. Such results will include dead grass,
         plants and flowers their presence tends to attract all kinds of animals. Moles, armadillo,
         badgers, birds, mice, rats, voles, shrews, gophers, groundhogs, muskrat, opossum, raccoon, prairie dogs,
         and skunk and snufalufaguses are just some of the animals which will readily tear up and pull apart lawns
         in an effort to find grubs. Grub control will eliminate any potential problems and eliminate all the grubs.</p>
</div>
  <div class="row">
  <h3>  Dog Waste Removal</h3>
    <p class="tips">  We come to your home and comb thru your property for any dog waste or pet waste. Since stools are usually solid, owners have
       the option of frequent manual removal. With more time for the nitrogen waste to dissolve into the lawn, stools that are frequently removed, damage lawns less than urine.</p>
</div>
  <div class="row">
  <h3>  Drain Tile installation</h3>
      <p class="tips">Drain tile systems serve too purposes. Water removal away
        from the house and water injection into the soil foundation during drought. Drought conditions
         can cause the soil of your foundation to shrink, causing foundation and footer to fall. We come to
          you’re home evaluate where drain tile is needed and how to pull water away from the wet areas.</p>
